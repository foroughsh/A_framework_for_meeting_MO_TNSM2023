# Emulation of the client population

To emulate the client population, we use a load generator that is developed for our work. This component can generate different statistical or custom load patterns. 
In this work, we use a periodic load pattern generated by a Poisson process modulated by the sin function. We run two instances of this load generator that emulate two groups of clients 
(premium and freemium users).

The configuration of these load generators is different for each scenario.  

The load generator has two main parts, the part that generates the event timestamps and the second that sends the events at specified time. The following figure shows two examples of generated 
load based on the stochastic process and request rate generated by the load generator.
